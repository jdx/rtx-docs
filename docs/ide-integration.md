# IDE Integration

IDEs work better with shims than they do environment variable modifications. The simplest way is
to add the rtx shim directory to PATH.

For IntelliJ and VSCodeâ€”and likely others, you can modify `~/.zprofile` if your are using zsh or `~/.bashrc` if you are using bash with the following:

```sh
pathmunge() {
  if ! echo "${PATH}" | /usr/bin/grep -E -q "(^|:)$1($|:)"; then
    if [ "$2" = "after" ]; then
      PATH=${PATH}:$1
    else
      PATH=$1:${PATH}
    fi
  fi
}

pathmunge ~/.local/share/rtx/shims
```

This won't work for all of rtx's functionality. For example, arbitrary env vars in `[env]` will only be set
if a shim is executed. For this we need tighter integration with the IDE and a custom plugin. If you feel
ambitious, take a look at existing direnv extensions for your IDE and see if you can modify it to work for rtx.
Direnv and rtx work similarly and there should be a direnv extension that can be used as a starting point.

Alternatively, you may be able to get tighter integration with a direnv extension and using the
[`use_rtx`](/direnv) direnv function.

pathmunge() {
  if ! echo "${PATH}" | /usr/bin/grep -E -q "(^|:)$1($|:)"; then
    if [ "$2" = "after" ]; then
      PATH=${PATH}:$1
    else
      PATH=$1:${PATH}
    fi
  fi
}

pathmunge ~/.local/share/rtx/shims
